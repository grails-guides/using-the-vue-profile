This profile also defines a set of custom Gradle tasks, including a bootRun task to startup the client app. You can either start up the server and client apps separately:

[source,bash]
----
./gradlew server:bootRun
----

This will start the Grails application, which will be available at `http://localhost:8080`.

[source,bash]
.in another terminal
----
./gradlew client:serve
----

This will start the dev server for the Vue application, which will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

The client `build.gradle` file also includes a `bootRun` (for consistency with the `server` project), which means  you can take advantage of Gradleâ€™s parallel execution to run both client and server apps in a single command:

[source,bash]
----
./gradlew bootRun -parallel
----

There are several more `client` tasks which "wrap" the npm scripts in `package.json`, for building and testing the Vue app. You can run them with the Gradle wrapper, or run the scripts directly if you have `npm` installed.

[source,bash]
----
$ ./gradlew client:test
$ ./gradlew client:build
----

[source,bash]
.from the client directory:
----
$ npm test
$ npm run build
----

Again, please see the http://vuejs-templates.github.io/webpack/[template documentation] for more information on leveraging these scripts and the other features provided by Vue-CLI.
