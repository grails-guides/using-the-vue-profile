To get started with this profile, specify it when generating your app:

[source,groovy]
----
$ grails create-app myApp --profile=vue
----

You can also generate your project using the http://start.grails.org[Application Forge], either from the web interface or using the following `curl` command:

[source,bash]
----
curl -O start.grails.org/myApp.zip -d version=3.3.2 -d profile=vue
----


Take a look at the directory structure - you will see a typical Gradle multi-project build, with separate client and server projects.

[source,groovy]

`server` is of course our Grails application. The profile will generate a Grails app using the `rest-api` profile, which provides support for creating domain classes as restful resources as well as JSON and Markup views.

`client` is our Vue app.

The `client` project structure (with the exception of `build.gradle`, which is specific to the react profile) is all courtesy of `create-react-app`, and includes an excellent README file. In short, the `src/` directory is where the React code is kept, `public/` is for public resources that you wish to make available from your React app without going through webpack’s bundling - this directory also includes a template `index.html` file which is used to generate the React app’s home page. Again, see the `create-react-app` documentation for more details.


One significant customization of the `client` project (besides the Grails-branded UI) is the file `src/config.js`. This file is used to specify the URL of the backend, by default `http://localhost:8080`. It also obtains the current version of the React app from `package.json`.

[source, javascript]
----
import pjson from './../package.json';

export const SERVER_URL = 'http://localhost:8080/';
export const CLIENT_VERSION = pjson.version;
export const REACT_VERSION = pjson.dependencies.react;
----

You may edit the contents of this file to add additional variables or to change the `SERVER_URL` to point to another backend server.
